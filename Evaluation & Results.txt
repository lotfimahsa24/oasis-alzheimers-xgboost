### 🔍 Interpretation

* The model achieved **91% accuracy** and **AUC ≈ 0.97**, showing strong discriminative power.
* A balanced **F1-macro of 0.876** indicates reliable performance across both classes.
* The confusion matrices show very few false negatives, which is valuable for dementia detection use cases.
* **LogLoss (0.195)** confirms well-calibrated probabilistic predictions.

### 🚀 Notes

These results demonstrate that a relatively simple XGBoost pipeline, with standard preprocessing and tabular MRI-derived features, can provide an effective baseline for dementia classification. Future steps could include feature importance analysis (SHAP) and hyperparameter optimization.
